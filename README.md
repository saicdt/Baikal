# Data Lake
Data lake is a set of projects, which will cover data sync up, ETL, Cube system, monitoring/alert system, data mining/machine learing and AI system. Pharse I is comming soon, which focus on real time data sync up from RMDB to Hive.

### Why data lake?

Using OGG is not only for sync up data in real time but also for those databases with physical delete and update
